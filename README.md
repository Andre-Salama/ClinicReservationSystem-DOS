# ClinicReservationSystem-DOS

* This project was done using Java, and it's a DOS version of the project, which means the Console will be used to interact with the program.
* A similar project was done with GUI and will be submitted to GitHub soon (A link will be provided here to that project when available).
* This project was done by me and my colleagues at the university as part of a module's project. Modules were basically subjects we had to learn, in case you're not familiar with the term.

This project may or may not receive updates, to better reflect my own skills in programming, since not all parts were done by me (Some were done by my colleagues of course).
